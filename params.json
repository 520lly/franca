{"name":"Franca","tagline":"A framework for defining and transforming interfaces","body":"# Welcome to Franca!\r\n\r\nFranca is a powerful framework for definition and transformation of software interfaces.\r\nIt is used for integrating software components from different suppliers, which are built based on various runtime frameworks, platforms and IPC mechanisms. The core of it is _Franca IDL_ (Interface Definition Language), which is a textual language for specification of APIs.\r\n\r\n## Migration to github\r\n\r\nAs you are reading this, the migration of the Franca homepage and git repository to github is done. \r\nThe git repository has moved, and all issues (closed and open ones) have been migrated.\r\nHowever, some work is still to do, e.g., providing proper issue reports, migrating the wiki pages from EclipseLabs\r\nand providing a github-docs page including the Franca update site for use by the Eclipse installation process.\r\n\r\n## Franca goes Eclipse\r\n\r\nFranca will be established as an official Eclipse project. The proposal is available online: http://eclipse.org/proposals/modeling.franca/\r\n\r\n## Franca features\r\n\r\nAs Franca is based on Eclipse, there are some powerful tools which can be used to work with Franca. Most important, Franca offers a user-friendly editor for reviewing and editing Franca IDL files.\r\n\r\nThe following diagram shows the major benefits of using Franca.\r\n\r\n![Franca benefits](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/franca/franca/master/docs/web/images/FrancaBenefits.png)\r\n\r\n### Transformations and generation\r\nFranca offers a framework for building transformations from/to other IDLs (e.g., D-Bus, OMG-IDL or others)\r\nand code generation. We recommend using [Xtend](http://xtend-lang.org) for building the generators,\r\nbut it is generally possible to use other tools and languages which are based on EMF models or Java APIs for the task.\r\n\r\nSupport for the D-Bus Introspection format is available as installable feature of Franca.\r\n\r\n### Specification of dynamic behavior ###\r\nWith Franca, the dynamic behavior of client/server interactions can be specified using _protocol state machines_.\r\nTools are available to use these specifications for validating implementations,\r\ne.g., checking runtime traces against the expected order of events on the interface.\r\nA graphical viewer for protocol state machines is part of Franca.\r\n\r\n### Flexible deployment models\r\nIn specific application domains, it may be necessary to extend interface specifications by platform-\r\nor target-specific information. This is supported by Franca's deployment models, which allow these kind\r\nof extensions in a type-safe way.\r\nThus, role-based development workflows can be established: Platform architects own the deployment\r\nspecifications, whereas project architects and developers are responsible for providing the\r\nplatform-specific data for their actual interfaces.\r\n\r\n### Rapid interface prototyping\r\nGenerate a test environment for your interface instantly and see your interface in action!\r\nThis is accomplished by generating [eTrice](http://eclipse.org/etrice) models from Franca interfaces\r\nand generate executable Java code from these models. The test environment will consist of a client\r\ncomponent (acting as dynamic test case executor) and a server component (acting as an intelligent mock object).\r\n\r\n## Franca and CommonAPI\r\n\r\nIf you want to generate C++ code directly from Franca interface specifications,\r\n[CommonAPI C++](http://projects.genivi.org/commonapi) might be the proper solution.\r\nIt is designed to decouple generated API from the actual IPC stack and cooperates seamlessly with Franca.\r\nCommonAPI was created in the context of the [GENIVI](http://genivi.org) initiative.\r\n\r\n## Forum\r\n\r\nFor feedback and discussions around Franca there is a\r\nFranca forum at Google Groups, see http://groups.google.com/group/franca-framework.\r\n\r\n## Misc\r\n\r\nThere is an [online Franca presentation](http://ftp.itemis.de/presentations/franca_std/) available.\r\nThis can also be used nicely from smartphones and tablets.\r\n\r\nThe Franca framework has been built using the open source projects [EMF](http://www.eclipse.org/emf),\r\n[Xtext](http://www.xtext.org) and [Xtend](http://xtend-lang.org).\r\nThanks to all committers of those projects for their great and helpful contributions!\r\n\r\n![BuiltOnDEV](http://web-static-cloudfront.s3.amazonaws.com/images/badges/BuiltOnDEV.png)","google":"UA-62656875-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
